This skeleton contains all files needed to create a Node.js web application. 
Modules act as libraries to provide a vast array of functions. Many of them are unecessary but have been included
for testing purposes.

The following are required for account functionality:
- Express
- Validator
- Passport
- MondoDB

Jasmine is used for running tests to ensure proper functionality. Learn more at https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/node.html
